# Introduction
What influences love at first sight? Or, at least, love in the first four minutes?
Data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four "first date" with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.
The dataset also includes questionnaire data gathered from participants at different points in the process. These fields include: demographics, dating habits, self-perception across key attributes, beliefs on what others find valuable in a mate, and lifestyle information.
This experiment asked people four times to question the importance of each attribute. Time 1, Half way, Time 2, Time 3. Time 1 is the time before the dating events occur, and Half way is the time after half the dating events. Time 2 is the next day after dating events, and Time 3 is three or four weeks after the dating event.
After each dating event, each participant created a scorecard that scored partner¡¯s attributes.
From this experiment result, we could find out some interesting truth or tendency about love.
